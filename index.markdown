Shareabouts
==========

Shareabouts is a mapping app for crowd sourced public input. 

Shareabouts has a simple, fun interface that makes it easy to add your voice to the map: suggest a location, add a comment, support other suggestions and share locations with your friends and neighbors. Shareabouts gets out of the way, letting you focus on getting points on the map.

Shareabouts is a project from [OpenPlans](http://openplans.org/ "OpenPlans").
